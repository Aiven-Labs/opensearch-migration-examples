Contribute to OpenSearch Migration Examples
===========================================

We would love to have your additions to our examples! Please feel free to open an issue to discuss what you have in mind, or just send over a pull request with a clear description of what you are adding and why. Please, check in the section `Adding examples` below to understand the process.


Adding examples
---------------
In order to add an example, please follow those guidelines:

- First commit should be a full ES example duplicated in `es-main.py` and `main.py`
- Second commit should be full OS example in `os-main.py` and then change `main.py` to use the OS client with minimal changes

You will then use the second commit to show the client changes related to migration from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch in the README.md of your example. 
You can follow how it is done on `NodeJS example <https://github.com/aiven/opensearch-migration-examples/tree/main/node-client-migration>`_. 


Questions and suggestions
-------------------------

If you have questions, suggestions, or spot a problem then please open an issue and tell us all about it.

As an additional bonus, we love to hear what you are building with Aiven ðŸ¦€
